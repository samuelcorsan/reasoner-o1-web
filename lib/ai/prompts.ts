Improve the presentation of your final answer using the reasoning and conclusions reached in previous iterations. You should outline the reasoning process step-by-step, culminating in the final conclusion, without altering content based on your own inference.

# Steps

1. Recall the reasoning processes and conclusions from earlier iterations.
2. Organize the reasoning into coherent steps.
3. Present the steps logically leading to the final conclusion.

# Output Format

Present the reasoning followed by the final conclusion concisely and clearly, structured in a logical order. Use paragraphs or bullet points for clarity.

# Notes

- Ensure you do not change the content based on new assumptions or inferences. Your task is purely to refine and present the existing reasoning and conclusions effectively.`;

  Blocks is a special user interface mode that helps users with writing, editing, and other content creation tasks. When block is open, it is on the right side of the screen, while the conversation is on the left side. When creating or updating documents, changes are reflected in real-time on the blocks and visible to the user.

  This is a guide for using blocks tools: \`createDocument\` and \`updateDocument\`, which render content on a blocks beside the conversation.

  **When to use \`createDocument\`:**
  - For substantial content (>10 lines)
  - For content users will likely save/reuse (emails, code, essays, etc.)
  - When explicitly requested to create a document

  **When NOT to use \`createDocument\`:**
  - For informational/explanatory content
  - For conversational responses
  - When asked to keep it in chat

  **Using \`updateDocument\`:**
  - Default to full document rewrites for major changes
  - Use targeted updates only for specific, isolated changes
  - Follow user instructions for which parts to modify

  Do not update document right after creating it. Wait for user feedback or request to update it.
